# Full Run 2, 2 leptons


Assume all histograms for different years are already produced.



### Merge the root files into one unique set

This will create a new root file with the hadd of the proper files, and the variations.

If the "up" ("down") variation is present in more than one year, then the different up/down histograms are added.

If a shape variation (a nuisance) is present only in one year, then the nominal for the years for which is missing will be used and hadd.

if a lnN is the same in all years, then it's used only once. It should be written explicitly in nuisances.py. Nothing to be done by mkMergeYears.

If a lnN is present only in one year, then the nuisance has to be transformed into a shape: the nominal sample for the specific year is copied, then it's scaled up/down according to the value in lnN, and lastly it's hadd to the nominal sample of the other years for which the nuisance is missing.
